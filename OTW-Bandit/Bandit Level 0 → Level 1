## Bandit Level 0 → Level 1: My Approach

For this challenge, my goal was to find the password for the next level by locating and reading a file named `readme` in the home directory.

### My Steps:

1. **List the files**:
   I used the `ls` command to see all files in the directory and confirm the existence of the `readme` file.

2. **Check file permissions**:
   I ran `ls -l` to view the file permissions for `readme`. This let me verify that my user (`bandit0`) had read access to the file, meaning I was allowed to open it.

3. **Read the file**:
   With read access confirmed, I used `cat readme` to display the file contents and obtain the password needed for the next level.

### Reflection:

Understanding and checking file permissions is important in Linux, especially for security and CTF-style challenges like Bandit. This approach made sure I didn’t try to access a file I wasn’t allowed to, and built my confidence in basic command line navigation.
