# Bandit Challenges: Linux Skills Practice

After completing Linux content from CoderCo, I decided to put my knowledge to the test by working through several challenges on OverTheWire's Bandit wargame. These challenges helped reinforce my understanding of essential Linux commands, file permissions, SSH, and shell basics. Successfully solving these tasks boosted my confidence and deepened my practical skills in navigating and manipulating the Linux command line.
